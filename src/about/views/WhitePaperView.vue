		<h1>Lvlz Thesis</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			Lvlz or Levelz, pronounced 'Levels', is a task tracking and to-do list
			application modeled on the leveling and progression systems found in
			modern video games. These systems are built on incremental, metrics-based,
			progression tracking that provide the user with gradual rewards through
			incremental positive reinforcement queues and metrics-based feedback. Lvlz
			does this by giving the user the tools to define, plan, and record the
			individual activities and actions required to build a habit or master a
			skill; give real-time metrics to chart their progress and improvement in
			those habits or skills; and give the user the tools to define and plan
			larger goals that the individual actions are meant to work toward.
		</p>
		<h3>Concepts and Initial Thoughts</h3>
		<p>
			I always found it interesting that it was so easy to spend hundreds of
			hours playing video games, yet doing more productive things in life can be
			much more challenging. In many popular modern games your goal is to level
			up your character or earn new virtual items, but it takes time. It takes
			alot of time. Whether you realize it or not, it also takes alot of work,
			even if that work is fun.
		</p>
		<p>
			Meanwhile, we have things in our lives that we need to level up, too. We
			have skills we'd like to improve. Like learning a new career skill or
			getting better at a hobby. We may want to work out more to stay in shape,
			or focus our efforts to accomplish something meaningful. We have to study
			for school, do chores around our home regularly, and loads of other things
			that keep our lives moving forward in positive direction.
		</p>
		<p>
			Levelz is meant to bridge that gap between the fun we have in video games
			and the fun we can have while doing our simple everyday tasks, picking up
			a new habit, or working toward a goal.
		</p>
		<p>
			You'll add the things you want to do into Lvlz, then as you complete those
			things you'll mark them off in Lvlz to track your progress. In doing so,
			you'll earn Experience Points and other bonuses. Over time, the Experience
			Points that you earn will cause you to Level Up! Those other bonuses might
			be things like increasing one of statistics, improving your skill levels,
			and earning new in-app rewards.
		</p>
		<p>
			The game systems that keep gamers hooked, having fun and playing their
			video games, can be leveraged to get people hooked on the new habits and
			skills they desire to pick up in their day-to-day lives.
		</p>
		<h3>Video Game Achievements</h3>
		<p>
			Over the last few decades, the video game industry has grown to a
			multi-billion dollar behemoth. With more than 3 billion gamers world-wide,
			spending over $150 billion dollars per year on their games, it's grown to
			be bigger than other entertainment industry segments like movies and
			music... COMBINED! After playing video games for most of my life, it's
			easy to see why.
		</p>
		<p>
			In video games, you can escape the real world and indulge yourself in
			entire universes of fantasy. You take on the role of highly skilled
			characters with unique powers in magical, unreal, circumstances. You
			aren't bound by the restrictions of real life, and everything you
			accomplish is rewarded. Modern games are built to keep you playing by
			balancing the challenges you face with the rewards you're given. They're
			designed to keep you entertained and stimulated, gratified and interested.
			Fulfilled. The most well designed games are engineered to bring you a
			feeling of "immersion", to make you feel like you're a part of the game
			through a combination of sensory engagement, cognitively demanding tasks,
			and an interesting narrative or story.
		</p>
		<p>
			Modern video games have now gotten so good that it can be easy for gamers
			to spend hundreds of hours per month playing them. Yet, spending as much
			time on productive things in everyday life can be a much more difficult
			endeavor. Over the years it's become a normal occurence for gamers to
			procrastinate on real-life responsibilities by exploring the imaginary
			fantasy world of "Skyrim", or engaging in hours of fast-paced gun-fights
			in "Call of Duty". With this in mind it's really made me wonder what my
			life would be like today if I'd spent my accumulated 20,000 hours of
			gaming on something more tangible and useful.
		</p>
		<p>
			What's interesting is that in some of these games, we aren't really doing
			anything all that interesting with our time. For instance, in MMORPGs like
			'World of Warcraft', 'Everquest', or 'New World' we're tasked with
			repeatedly doing the same quests and missions over and over in order to
			increase our character's level. We're gathering and combining items with
			tradeskills just to increase small aspects of our character's development.
			In FPS games like 'Call of Duty', 'Counterstrike', or 'Destiny' we're
			doing missions over and over to earn new equipment for our character, just
			to see our statistics slightly increase. Things like these take many
			dozens, if not hundreds, of hours to complete... and the only rewards
			amount to improving these numbers on our character's statistics score.
			Sometimes, we might quest for rare novelty items that don't serve any
			score increase - they only 'look cool' or are highly desired by other
			players for the sake of collecting them.
		</p>
		<p>
			In an online environment, completing all these game achievements garner
			some bragging rights amongst other players. As a low level player just
			starting out, you will look around and see higher level players with
			really amazing items, interesting abilities, and special titles. This will
			make you think, "Man, how did they get all that stuff? I want that!", and
			so begins the goal/achievement cycle that pushes the player to keep
			questing after the next step in their adventure. New players will go up
			against high skilled seasoned players, only to get absolutely decimated.
			This will make them wonder how they lost so badly and how they get better
			at playing the game - they'll look up straegy guides and YouTube tutorial
			videos that explain the advanced techniques to play the game better.
		</p>
		<p>
			Meanwhile, the many hours and days spent accomplishing these quests,
			missions, tasks, collections, or 'grinding' the repetative practice
			required to get better at playing the game will inevidably detract from
			progress in day-to-day life. If all that time spent playing video games
			was instead spent learning something fun like playing guitar, or rock
			climbing... then chances are more fulfilling opportunities would become
			available in life - people to meet and places to go! If it was spent
			building a new skill like welding, carpentry, or programming... then more
			job opportunities and chances for upward ecomonic advancement would become
			available. If it was spent completing schooling or training, taking care
			of responsibilities at home, or with family and friends... then the case
			could be made that life would continue to improve beyond anything that a
			video game could realistically offer.
		</p>
		<h2>Phased Prototype Development (2021-2022)</h2>
		<p>
			The first prototype for Lvlz will be developed through a series of Phases,
			each requiring a few months worth of work to create the initial systems.
			Below is a description of these phases and systems which will be developed
			throughout the years 2021 and 2022.
		</p>
		<h3>Phase 1 - Activities/Actions Framework</h3>
		<p>
			<i>Estimated time frame: April to June 2021</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			It's with this framework of completing small 'Actions' that constitute the
			practice or completion of an 'Activity', that granular performance metrics
			can help to reward the user and reinforce a consistent habit of
			participating in the 'Activity' regularly. The successful completion of an
			'Activity' incrementally increases the score count of a 'Skill' associated
			with it. This act of accumulating 'Skill' points further reinforces the
			user's habit of consistently working to complete or practice the 'Actions'
			which fulfill the completion of it's associated 'Activity'.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Activity</strong> - A small project or pursuit which may be
				repeated in intervals of days or weeks, to achieve a measurable outcome
				that may improve a skill. Examples: Practice Piano, Do Math Homework,
				Workout At The Gym, Clean The House, Read A Book, etc.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Action</strong> - A specific act or unit of work with a small
				scope that can be completed relatively quickly and repetatively, but may
				or may not be completed successfully or with high quality. Constitutes a
				part of an Activity, in concert with other associated or similar
				Actions; OR classifies a more specific form of an Activity. Examples:
				Play a C Major Scale on Piano, Do a Non-Linear System of Equations Math
				Problem, Do A Set of Dumb-bell Upright Rows, Vacuum The Carpet, Read
				"High Performance Habits" by Brendan Burchard, etc.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Action Forms</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<i>Form A:</i> An Action that defines a part of an Activity which
						may or may not complete the Activity. An Activity may be "Practice
						Piano", it's Actions may be "Play '&lt;Song Name #1&gt;'", "Play
						'&lt;Song Name #2&gt;'", and "Play the G-Major Scale", etc. In this
						case, one Activity session may include numerous similar actions.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>Form B:</i> An Action that more specifically classifies an
						Activity. An Activity may be "Read A Book", the Action may be "Read
						'&lt;Title&gt;' by &lt;Author&gt;". In this case, one Activity
						session may include one, more specific, Action.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Action Types</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Simple Actions - An Action which are marked as completed, like a
						simple to-do list item.
					</li>
					<li>
						Gradable Actions - An Action which, when completed, is assigned an
						integer based grade of quality. Metrics like the running average
						quality of repeated Action completions can illustrate and prove
						measured skill increases and decreases.
					</li>
					<li>
						Progress Action - An Action which increments or decrements the value
						of a running count. This value can build to a goal total which
						defines completion or counts down from a starting value which
						completes at zero.
					</li>
					<li>
						Timed Action - An Action which includes a timer that counts down
						from a chosen duration, where the timer can be paused to allow a
						better expression of actual time performing the Action. This value
						can count up to a total goal of time which defines completion, or
						counts until the Action is completed at which point it's stopped and
						stored for metrics.
					</li>
					<li>
						Stopwatch Action - An Action which includes a timer that counts up
						from zero. Operates like a stopwatch which can be split into 'lap'
						intervals or paused.
					</li>
					<li>
						Combination Action - An Action which combines one or more types to
						provide more specific metrics.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<br />
		<h4>Action Configuration:</h4>
		<p>
			When created, Actions are given a name and description. They can be given
			one or more Types. By default Actions are of the Simple Type, where they
			take the form of a to-do list item. This means that they are either set as
			incomplete and marked as complete, or marked as completed repeatedly.
			Although some meta data can be derived from simple Actions, like the date
			and time they were completed and how many times they were completed;
			Actions are most useful when they are assigned additional types.
		</p>
		<p>
			Activities that rely on improving the quality of their Actions, like
			practicing a musical instrument or some other skill may benefit from being
			a Gradable action. Each attempt or repetition of the Action is graded on a
			number scale of the user's choosing, like 0 to 5. Where 0 is a failure and
			5 is a perfect success. Adjective terms to describe the various grades on
			the scale can be defined by the user or generic template grades should be
			made available. (Example: 5-Perfect, 4-Excellent, 3-Good, 2-Average,
			1-Bad, 0-Failure).
		</p>
		<p>
			Progress Actions can be implemented when a running count of Action
			repetitions leading up to a sum completion count defines success. Like
			doing a set of exercises, where exercise repetitions are completed, or
			reading a book, where page count completions define success.
		</p>
		<p>
			Applying a Timed or Stopwatch type to the Action can measure the time
			required to complete it, where increasing speed is a measure of
			improvement, or where a goal to perform an Action for at least a specified
			amount of time defines improvement.
		</p>
		<h4>Action Metrics</h4>
		<p>
			<i>
				TODO: More information on metrics coming soon, possibly moved to a
				future phase of development.
			</i>
		</p>
		<h4>Activities and Actions Use Cases:</h4>
		<p>
			In order to architect and develop the Activity/Action framework, a
			selection of Use Cases will be implemented to test and improve the
			Activity/Action user interface and workflow. Further use cases and
			Activity/Action example libraries will be built over time.
		</p>
		<h5>Use Case #1: Practice Skateboarding</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>
				'Olympic-style' Skateboarding is based on the performance tricks -
				difficult manuvers that require repetative practice to perfect.
			</li>
			<li>
				Tricks will be listed as Actions in the 'Practice Skateboarding'
				Activity and given the Gradable type.
			</li>
			<li>
				Each time a trick is attempted during practice, that trick's Action will
				be graded. During a practice session, the same trick will be attempted
				multiple times with a goal to improve consistency and quality.
			</li>
			<li>
				Over the course of multiple practice sessions, the metrics of trick
				qualities will be used to guide which tricks should be practiced more.
				Lower average grades will get more practice attention.
			</li>
			<li>
				Improving the consistency of skateboard trick attempts over time will be
				the major goal of this use case, as will be the incorporation of new
				tricks to learn and practice.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h5>
			Use Case #2: Regularly engage in reading for education and fun
		</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Picking up a habit of regularly reading for enjoyment and to further
				knowledge in an area of expertise is something I've struggled with
				consistently adopting. This use-case will test and experiment using
				Activities to help support this habit.
			</li>
			<li>
				Each book I intend to read will be added as Actions titled with the
				book's title and categorized under Activities entitled "Read a Fiction
				Book", "Read a Non-Fiction Book", or "Study a Textbook". These Actions
				will be given the Progress and Timed types in order to track the pages
				completed and amount of time used.
			</li>
			<li>
				While reading fiction and non-fiction, the metrics of pages per minute
				will be used to track improvement in reading speed and focus. While
				studying textbooks other metrics will be considered, a system of
				scheduled study times will be explored and tested for viability.
			</li>
			<li>
				Improving reading speed and consistency with regularly reading as
				planned will be the main goal of this use case.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h5>Use Case #3: Learn a new programming language</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Software development is learned and mastered through extensive practice
				and continued research into more techniques, syntax, architecture, and
				algorithms.
			</li>
			<li>
				This use case will revolve around learning and practicing popular
				programming languages I am unfamiliar with (Python, C++, Rust, Scala,
				etc.). This will be supported by online learning websites like
				FreeCodeCamp.com, Codecademy.com, TeamTreehouse.com, and
				Pluralsight.com; who provide defined learning paths and curriculum,
				which can be translated into Activities and Actions on Levelz.app.
			</li>
			<li>
				Success in this use case will be defined and supported by not only
				completing the required tasks on the learning websites, but also
				engaging in regular practice, fun personal projects, and
				researching/studying topics that aren't provided by the learning
				websites.
			</li>
			<li>
				This use case will need to utilize Simple, Progress, and Timed action
				types; along with possibily looking to define further features not yet
				described but required to adequately complete the use case and gather
				adequate metrics.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>General Activity/Action Framework Thoughts and Goals</h4>
		<p>
			The first goals for Activities and Actions revolve around finding generic
			ways to encourage and reinforce continued practice or repetitive
			engagement in actions that the user desires to do. A deeper analysis of
			the workflow and improvement on the UI will be done over time, in concert
			with studies on UI/UX development and Habit topics. Primarily this
			includes books like "Atomic Habits", "Ultralearning", "High Performance
			Habits", "7 Habits of Highly Effective People", "Indistractible", and
			"Hooked"; along with other contemporary literature.
		</p>
		<p>
			A main goal is to make the User feel involved and invested in their own
			process and subsequent success. Each step of the way they are encouraged
			by what they've done so far, and the continued effort to sustaining their
			progress should be made to not only feel possible and achievable; but
			highly likely. Failures should be encouraged and rewarded almost as
			readily as successes, as failure is often required in order to accomplish
			just about anything. Finding ways to support the User gradually reducing
			failure will be a key challenge with this system. Through encouraging the
			User to play an active role in planning and refining their Activities,
			Actions, Goals, and making the app enjoyable to use; it's expected that
			this failure reduction, acceptability, reward, regular use, and continued
			encouragement will be maximized.
		</p>
		<p>
			The act of defining what is needed to be done when preparing to practice a
			skill or complete a task can often be clear indicator in success. In
			"Ultralearning", the author explains that when approaching learning a new
			skill is highly recommended to explore the full scope of what's required
			to learn the skill. This sets the expectation for material to be covered
			and work required to realistic levels right away. Decomposing the larger
			concepts of a task into these smaller hierarchical labels of 'Activities'
			and 'Actions' can help to illustrate the relatively small effort required
			to get started with and continue a good habit. This is covered throughout
			"Atomic Habits", which explains that the key to picking up new positive
			desired habits or learning a new skill is substantially easier when they
			are viewed as smaller minor changes in behavior that add up over time.
		</p>
		<p>
			The process of the User being mainly responsible for creating and
			customizing their Activity/Action lists gives them control and stake in
			the process from the beginning. This way, the user is less intimidated by
			the unknown portions of the task and encouraged to write their own
			'instruction manual' for incremental success. They define how and when it
			will be done and they can be reminded to do it when it's scheduled through
			notifications, if required. Then, refine this process further over time,
			especially if higher than desired failure rates are encountered. The
			unknown and the failures in the process should be given the opportunity to
			be embraced and left to the user to discover the solutions for. A great
			deal of focus will be made to outline solutions of how to enable this
			process of discovery but will be ultimately guided by the social
			encouragement and guidance of other members in the app's social features
			(phase 4).
		</p>
		<br />
		<h3>Phase 2 - Experience/Skill rewards and Tasks</h3>
		<p>
			<i>Estimated time frame: June to August 2021</i>
		</p>
		<h4>Experience Points</h4>
		<p>
			This phase will incorporate a system of rewards to the app that are
			granted with the successful completion of Actions. The act of finishing
			any Action will reward Experience Points that contribute to the User's
			Level. This 'Level' will be an overall expression of the User's
			involvement in the app. Each level will have a certain amount of
			experience points required to achieve it. Once achieved the User will be
			rewarded with fun novelty prizes and other unique gifts that are yet to be
			determined.
		</p>
		<p>
			Normally in RPG video games, when the User's character levels up their
			statistic points like 'Strength', 'Stamina', 'Wisdom', etc. are increased.
			Sometimes this will be given as a set of points that can be assigned by
			the User, other times the statistics are simply added by the game engine
			automatically. It would be ideal to be able to add statistic points on
			Lvlz.app that reflect what type of Actions the User completed throughout
			the duration of the previous level when the User gains a new level. This
			concept will be more possible given the following 'skill point' system.
		</p>
		<h4>Skill Points</h4>
		<p>
			Each Activity and Action will be able to be assigned to one or more skill
			categories. These skill categories and the points earned within them will
			be an expression of the ability level that the User possesses as a result
			of repeatedly practicing or completing Actions. For instance, a skill
			category of Guitar Playing may be created and the Activity/Actions related
			to this skill like "Practice Guitar" and "Practice Scales for 30 minutes"
			the Guitar Playing skill may be assigned to them. Each completion of these
			Activities/Actions will give a chance to increase the Guitar Playing skill
			level. Eventually, given many hours of practice or study of Guitar related
			work should then result in the User having a 'Guitar Playing' skill of 100
			or 200. This skill point level of 200 will be a progression toward some
			level cap total point level that defines master professional Guitar
			Playing, like 1000 or 10000. These skill points may be a direct expression
			of hours spent playing, or since they have a percentage chance of increase
			with each Action completion, it may just be a less specific arbitrary
			number that just gives an idea of general aptitude.
		</p>
		<p>
			As the app continues to be developed and more structured default skill
			paths are included to the app in the future, more concrete skill points
			and ability levels can be created by professionals in various disciplines
			and added to the app. During this early work on the app, skill levels
			won't necessarily be scaled and computed to be perfect descriptions of
			actual real-life ability of the User.
		</p>
		<h4>Tasks</h4>
		<p>
			This phase will also focus on tasks. Tasks are mid-range goals which are
			defined as a change in habit or skill level that's achievable within
			approximately 2-3 months. They are milestones that can be linked to the
			repeated completion of Activities/Actions.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>TODO: More information on tasks will be added here soon.</i>
		</p>
		<h3>Phase 3 - Quests and Inventory Systems</h3>
		<p>
			<i>Estimated time frame: August to November 2021</i>
		</p>
		<h4>Quests</h4>
		<p>
			Quests are long term goals that require more than a year to complete. They
			define the largest incremental progressive achievements that the User may
			plan for themselves on Lvlz, and require the completion of multiple Tasks
			and many, many Actions. Quests are things like 'Complete my First Year of
			High School', 'Complete my Bachelor's degree', or 'Become a Professional
			(xyz)'. They may be less official goals like 'Practice (Skill) for 10,000
			Hours' or 'Learn to Play Van Halen\'s "Eruption" Perfectly'.
		</p>
		<p>
			Although this is the last skill planning functionality to be phased in to
			Lvlz in this prototype, it's logical for this to be the first step a User
			will take in creating their own goals. A user will be able to sit down and
			think 'What do I want to accomplish?', and create a Quest from that
			thought. Then break that idea down into smaller portions to create Tasks
			and link them to the Quest. Next, they would break down that Task into
			daily or hourly Activities that should be done regularly. Finally, they
			would try to figure all the smallest Actions which should be done to
			complete that Activity.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>TODO: More details on Quests will be coming soon</i>
		</p>
		<h4>Inventory System</h4>
		<p>
			In video games, especially RPGs, the player will often have an Inventory
			menu which lists all the weapons and armor that their character is
			wearing. Throughout their adventures in the game, they aquire new
			equipment and many other odds and ends that help them complete their
			goals.
		</p>
		<p>
			Just as the Quests, Tasks, Activities, and Actions are important to build
			a skill or accomplish a goal; so are the tools and items that are needed
			to get the job done. The Inventory System is all about keeping track of
			the equipment and items that the User has at their disposal.
		</p>
		<p>
			In every hobby, skill, or profession there's a general importance to be
			well versed in the equipment involved. Seasoned guitar players know all
			about their guitar, the brand and model, the electrical components like
			the pick-ups; their amplifier, it's speakers and settings; their effects
			pedals, thier settings and configurations. Welders know all about their
			tools and what's needed to get the job done; tattoo artists know all about
			their guns and needles, the inks, creams, transfer paper, and tracing
			light-box.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the onset, the Lvlz Inventory system can provide a way to keep track of
			your stuff in a private searchable database. This can obviously be useful
			for insurance or tax reasons if you goals involve a business, but also
			keeping track of what you use during your Activities so that you can stay
			stocked up. If your Activities involve creating or producing items, then
			the Inventory system can help keep track of what you have on hand. This
			may mean just being aware of your production efficiency or assisting with
			the sales of your items.
		</p>
		<p>
			During this prototype phase, these concepts will be explored and systems
			to handle multiple use cases will be tested.
		</p>
		<h3>Phase 4 - Social Platform and Activity Template Sharing</h3>
		<p>
			<i>Estimated time frame: November 2021 to December 2022</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			With the core systems of the app started and being perfected, the core
			social networking features of the app will be developed. This will include
			public user profiles; user to user interaction within Lvlz like messaging,
			friending, and commenting on others' resources; public user activity
			feeds; sharing Lvlz activity and achievements on popular social media
			sites.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>
				More information on the Social Platform features will be added near the
				end of 2021.
			</i>
		</p>
		<h3>Phase 5 - Quest/Task/Activity Templates</h3>
		<p>
			<i>Estimated time frame: April 2022 to December 2022</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			Just because you have the desire to learn a new skill or practice a hobby
			doesn't necessarily mean you know all the best ways to complete that task.
			Lvlz can give you the tools to create your own practice regimens and line
			up your own activity/action lists, but if you're unsure of what to
			practice or do to gain mastery you may be inclined to put off beginning
			the process. Data entry isn't the most fun thing to do in the world.
			That's where Templates can help.
		</p>
		<p>
			A major component of what will make Lvlz a powerful tool for its users
			will be the ability to download and share pre-defined templates for
			Quests, Tasks, and Activities. Teachers, Experts, and Users who are
			experienced in a given skill or hobby will be able to create a template
			which defines all the Activities they think are required to gain mastery
			in it. Users who are looking for a starting point in that skill will be
			able to browse through a marketplace of templates on Lvlz and download
			them to begin their journey.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the case that Users want to learn how to play guitar, they may find a
			Guitar 101 template on Lvlz. Where a user may want to start learning how
			to program computers, they can browse through templates that can get them
			started like 'Introduction to JavaScript', or 'Advanced C++'. Guitar
			teachers can teach and monitor their students with their own custom made
			Quests, programming teachers at the local community college can assign
			homework on Lvlz that guides their students through assignments and
			practice exercises in the form of Tasks and Activities.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>More information on Templates will be added in 2022</i>
