							Levelz is a productivity web app that looks to help you reinforce
							your good habits, stay productive, and level up in life!
						</p>
						<p>
							It's a very new app! Hardly even a prototype. This prototype
							should be ready to start using sometime at the beginning of 2021.
						</p>
						<p>
							Right now I'm simply working to build Lvlz so that its useful for
							me, personally. To help stay productive and use everyday. I
							believe that if the app is easy, fun, rewarding and engaging for
							me - it has a chance to be enjoyed by other people.
						</p>
						<p>
							Here's what I have in mind to work on throughout 2020 and 2021.

						<h2>Making life as fun as a video game!</h2>
						<p>
							I always found it interesting that it was so easy to spend
							hundreds of hours playing video games, yet doing more productive
							things in life can be much more challenging. In many games you can
							level up your character or earn new virtual items. In RPG games
							like Skyrim, you also level up your character's skills and spells.
							In FPS games like Call of Duty you level up your weapon abilities
							and unlock new attachments, but it takes time. It takes alot of
							time. Whether you realize it or not, it also takes alot of work,
							even if that work is fun.
						</p>
						<p>
							Meanwhile, we have things in our lives that we need to level up.
							We have skills we'd like to improve, like learning a new career
							skill, getting better at a hobby, working out more to stay in
							shape, or accomplishing something meaningful. We have to study for
							school, do chores around our home regularly, and loads of other
							things to keep moving forward in life.
						</p>
						<p>
							So I'm making Levelz to bridge that gap between the fun we have in
							video games and the fun we can have while doing our simple
							everyday tasks.
						</p>
						<p>
							You'll add the things you want to do into Lvlz, then as you
							complete those things you'll earn Experience Points and other
							bonuses. Over time, the Experience Points that you earn will cause
							you to Level Up! Those other bonuses might be things like
							increasing one of your statistics, improving one of your skill
							levels, or earning a new in-app item like a piece of armor, a
							weapon, or some other loot!
						</p>
						<h2>Actions and Activities</h2>
						<p style="font-size:0.8em;">Est. completion Sept 2020</p>
						<p>
							The stuff we do in life can be broken down into the little Actions
							during the Activities we do. So on Lvlz this is a great place to
							start. On Lvlz you can set up an Activity that you're going to do
							and add the Actions it takes to finish it. Like a to-do list, an
							Activity is something you'd like to accomplish and an Action is a
							small piece of work that Activity requires. Then, as you complete
							Actions you can quickly mark them as 'Finished'; and once you
							finish all the Actions - the Activity is marked as 'Done' and you
							earn some rewards and bonuses for your accomplishment.
						</p>
						<h4>Simple Activity Lists</h4>
						<p>
							An example of an Activity might be something simple like "Clean
							The House". If you want, you can simply create this Activity and
							add it to your list of things to do for the day. Equally, other
							Activities might be "Do Homework", "Walk The Dog", "Pay The Bills"
							etc. Creating simple Activities and marking them off as you do
							them is a fast and easy way to get started. This functionality is
							similar to what you may find on other apps like
							<a href="https://habitica.com/static/home" target="_blank">
								Habitica
							</a>
							(which is a fantastic app, you should go check it out!) but
							Lvlz.app can help you organize things further and in more
							customizable ways.
						</p>
						<h4>More Activity Details: Actions</h4>
						<p>
							Lvlz.app allows you to track the Actions you take while you "Clean
							The House". Its Actions might be things like "Do the Dishes", "Do
							the Laundry", "Take out the Trash", or "Organize the Living Room".
							Adding Actions can help you remember particular things you need to
							do to finish the Activity. They can remind you of where you left
							off in an Activity. They assist you in being more organized and
							deliberate in your Activities, which may lead you to get better at
							them!
						</p>
						<h4>Activity/Action Hierarchies</h4>
						<p>
							Now, that simple Activity/Action example might work great for most
							people and most activities you might want to do, but we can make
							it more detailed if we need to. Let's look at that same example,
							but isolate one of the Actions: "Do the Laundry". In truth, doing
							the laundry takes a few Actions of its own to complete. For this
							reason, you have the option to turn that into an Activity and add
							Actions to it in the same way. Things like "Get Quarters", "Go to
							the Laundromat", "Gather the Clothes", "Start the Washer", "Move
							Clothes Into The Dryer", and "Fold the Clothes" could all be
							examples of Actions added to the "Do the Laundry" Activity.
						</p>
						<h4>Gradable Actions</h4>
						<p>
							You can use Activities for fun things too, like your hobbies. A
							good example of this is my own first use case: practicing
							skateboarding! For this I would create an Activity like "Practice
							Skateboard Tricks" and my Actions might be "Do a Kickflip", or "Do
							a 360 Flip". For Actions like these, you might want to keep track
							of how well you do them by marking them as 'Gradable' Actions and
							setting up different grades to assign Actions as you do them. Like
							for skateboarding I've assigned 6 grade scores that use skate
							terms to describe the quality of my attempt at the trick, from
							'Slam' (or 'Fall') that has a score of 0, 'Fail' (score 1),
							'Sloppy' (2), 'Average' (3), 'Good' (4), 'Clean' (5), and
							'Perfect' (6).
						</p>
						<h2>Tasks and Quests</h2>
						<p style="font-size:0.8em;">Est. completion Oct 2020</p>
						<p>
							More information on Tasks and Quests will be added here once
							Activities and Actions are up and running. In the meantime, heres
							some basic information about them.
						</p>
						<h4>Tasks</h4>
						<p>
							Tasks are for larger goals that are too big to put into one single
							Activity and require numerous Activities to finish. These are
							things that might take many days, weeks or months of incremental
							work to achieve. Essentially, they're an easy way for you to
							organize and arrange your Activities.
						</p>
						<h4>Quests</h4>
						<p>
							Quests are for long term goals that require several Tasks to
							finish. Just as Tasks organize many Activities together, Quests
							organize many Tasks together. Examples a Quest might be completing
							your college degree, writing a book, or learning a new profession.
							Quests are the epic things in life that really move us into new
							realms in the world. They aren't for the faint of heart. They
							require dedication and commitment! But with the consistent effort
							of finishing smaller Activities everyday and completing their
							Tasks, we hope that Lvlz.app can help make them feel more
							possible.
						</p>
						<h3>Rewards and Bonuses</h3>
						<p>
							Along the way, as I work on the features that were just explained
							here, a Rewards system will be baked in to help make things fun.
							When you create your Activities, Tasks, and Quests you can set
							them to grant some default rewards based on how difficult you deem
							them to be (with difficulty levels like Easy, Medium, Hard,
							Impossible, etc.). This would grant Experience Points according to
							the difficulty level. So, more difficult Activities give less
							Experience than easier Activities. Other bonuses can be set, where
							"Read a Book" Activity might increase your Intelligence statistic,
							or "Workout at the Gym" might increase your Strength statistic.
						</p>
						<h2>Inventory System</h2>
						<p style="font-size:0.8em;">Est. Nov 2020</p>
						<p>
							In Role Playing video games, you'll often have an inventory of
							items that you can use for various things in the game. You might
							have a set of Armor that your character wears, or a Weapon that
							they wield. In First-Person Shooter games, you might have sets of
							different types of guns and a sets of attachments or upgrades to
							those guns that you can unlock as you progress through the game.
							In much the same way, we have an inventory in the real world!
							Clothes, Furniture, Tech Gadgets, Accessories, and wide array of
							other things. From supplies and food we buy regularly when
							shopping, to items we hold on to and use all the time like
							appliances and tools, it makes sense to me that keeping track of
							the stuff we have and things we use would help anyone stay
							organized, save money when shopping, and get prepared to start
							doing Activities!
						</p>
						<p>
							Concepts for the Inventory system on Lvlz.app are simple right
							now. Adding the things we own into the app through manual data
							entry or easier methods like barcode scanning would build up your
							inventory. Associating them to links on the internet (like retail
							listings, or manufacturers websites) would make it easier to
							replace them or service them. Adding notes about them that we
							might find useful later would help keep track of them or remember
							things about them. Attaching them to 'Supply Lists' for Activities
							would assist in completing those Activities - knowing what items
							we need to get them done.
						</p>
						<h2>The Big Picture: Long Term Goals</h2>
						<p>
							Building the Activity/Action system, the Quest/Task system, the
							Rewards/Bonuses system, and the Inventory system is more than
							enough to keep me busy for the rest of 2020 and well into 2021.
							Yet, it's just the beginning of my long term goals for what I'd
							like to see Lvlz.app become. Here are some Tasks that I'm
							personally on a Quest to complete one day - they are only ideas
							right now. Where I have time during this prototype phase
							(2020-2022) I will be testing out and experimenting with these
							ideas.
						</p>
						<h4>Premade Content and Preset Settings</h4>
						<h5>Default Templates</h5>
						<p style="font-size:0.8em;">Est. middle of 2021</p>
						<p>
							It's clear to me that organizing your own Activities may be too
							tedious for many users. Manually entering data, setting things up,
							and getting an Activity ready to use is an entire Activity
							in-of-itself! After prototyping and building the core systems of
							the App, creating Activities / Tasks / Quests, adding Inventory,
							and working with the App on my own - I will have quite a few
							simple Activities already made. So it would be incredibly helpful
							to include Templates for for things Activities to get started.
						</p>
						<h5>User-Made Templates</h5>
						<p style="font-size:0.8em;">Est. end of 2021</p>
						<p>
							Lvlz.app probably won't be ready for prime-time for a long time.
							So, I'm currently working off of the idea that people won't be
							using this app any time soon. Yet, just as I would be able to set
							up Premade Activities and Preset Templates it would make alot of
							sense to give the Lvlz.app user community the ability to do the
							same. There is an endless list of things I have no idea how to do,
							and would never do, that people out there need to do every day.
						</p>
						<p>
							Once the user community grows, sharing and connecting with other
							people about what they do and how they use Lvlz will be a powerful
							and rewarding experience that I can't wait to help provide!
						</p>
						<h5>Assignments</h5>
						<p style="font-size:0.8em;">Est. end of 2021</p>
						<p>
							Not everyone knows what they should do to be more productive or
							get things done. While right now Lvlz.app would be mostly aimed at
							self-starters that need a tool to help organize what they're
							already doing. That's how I'll be using it. However, I think it's
							important to build an Assignment system that can give users a big
							list of ideas and options of the kind of Activities they could do
						</p>
						<h4>So much more...</h4>
						<p>
							I'm planning to work on Lvlz for many years. Once the core of the
							app is up and running in a way that's enjoyable to use... I feel
							like the sky's the limit! These are some of the ideas that I've
							been testing and working on.
						</p>
						<p>
							"Lvlz could..."
						</p>
						<h5>Help Manage Your Finances</h5>
						<p style="font-size:0.8em;">Est. 2022</p>
						<p>
							Lvlz could assist with managing your finances, organize your
							budget, helping you save money,
						</p>
						<h5>Help Plan Your Travel</h5>
						<p style="font-size:0.8em;">Est. 2022</p>
						<p>
							Lvlz could assist with Travel, helping you coordinate and plan
							your trips.
						</p>
						<h5>Provide You With Education</h5>
						<p style="font-size:0.8em;">Est. 2023</p>
						<p>
							Lvlz could provide the tools for a learning environment where
							Teachers can set up classes and Students can join them to study,
							learn course materials, and be tested to achieve some credentials.
