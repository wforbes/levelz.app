1 - Download and install https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert/releases
2 - Copy the downloaded exe into an easily accessible folder (I chose C:/Program Files/mkcert/)
3 - Rename the exe to 'mkcert'
4 - Create a PATH environment variable that points to the folder from step 2
5 - Open cmd as admin and run 'mkcert -install' to create Root CA files (these appear in C:/Users/<your user>/AppData/Local/mkcert)
6 - In cmd, navigate to this 'certs' folder in this project
7 - In cmd, run 'mkcert localhost'
8 - Ensure the vue.config.js in this project has the devServer, https property
9 - Run this project with 'npm run serve'
10 - Open internet browser to https://localhost:8080 to ensure this worked
